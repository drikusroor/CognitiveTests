# CognitiveTests
Cognitive Tests are a series of tests created to be used for the experiments conducted for my Master Thesis (2015) and a [follow-up article](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00288) (2016). Now (2017), the experiments will be slightly revamped to be used for another series of experiments.

## Tests
Currently there are three tests available, two of which will be maintained and a third one that will be *phased out* as I have made a new version in a different repo.

### The Backward Digit Span
A test in which the subject has to recall a set of digits in backward order. The test starts with a set of two digits. The amount of digits in a set increments after every two trials.

### The Mottier Test
A test in which the subject has to recall a set of syllables. The test starts with a set of two syllables. After every 6th set, the amount of syllables per set increments.

### The Musical Ear Test
[The Musical Ear Test](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2010.02.004) is a test in which the subject hears two short musical fragments and then has to say whether these two fragments were identical or not. The test consists of two parts:
1. The melodic part
The melodic part consists of 52 trials. In each trial the subject hears two melodic fragments and then has to tell whether these melodic fragments were identical or not.
2. The rhythmic part
The rhythmic part consists of 52 trials. In each trial the subject hears two rhythmic fragments and then has to tell whether these rhythmic fragments were identical or not.

This test will be phased out in favor of the [new version](https://github.com/drikusroor/MusicalEarTestApp).

## Languages

Right now, the tests are available in several languages: Chinese, Turkish and Dutch. The future might cause the tests to be available in even more languages! If you would like to supply instructions and/or audio files for other languages, you are more than welcome to participate.
