# CognitiveTests
Cognitive Tests are a series of tests created to be used for the experiments conducted for my Master Thesis (2015) and a [follow-up article](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00288) (2016). Now (2017), the experiments will be slightly revamped to be used for another series of experiments.

## Tests
Currently there are three tests available, two of which will be maintained and a third one that will be *phased out* as I have made a new version in a different repo.

### The Backward Digit Span

### The Mottier Test

### The Musical Ear Test

Right now, the tests are available in several languages: Chinese, Turkish and Dutch. The future might cause the tests to be available in even more languages!
